*** Global balances ***

Notation:

  (most of the notation is described in README_eqns)

  [f]   = the box average of f

  xy(f) = average of f over x and y (streamwise and spanwise directions)

  @/@z  = partial derivative with respect to z


We consider the balances of three quantities:

                           
  Potential energy = PE =  Re Pr [-z Tf]

                           Re Pr
  Thermal   energy = TE =  ----- [tt^2]
                             2

                           1
  Kinetic   energy = KE =  - [|u|^2]
                           2

The balances of the two thermal quantities are:

  d PE
  ---- =  Nu_bndy - Nu_conv
   dt

  d TE
  ---- =  Nu_conv - Nu_diss
   dt

where the three instantaneous Nusselt numbers are defined as

               1    @ xy(Tf) |         @ xy(Tf) |
  Nu_bndy =  - - (  -------- |      +  -------- |      ) 
               2       @z    | z=1        @z    | z=-1

             
  Nu_conv =  Re Pr [u_3 Tf] + 1


  Nu_diss =  [|grad Tf|^2]


The balance of kinetic energy is given by

  d KE
  ---- =  Prod + Conv - Diss
   dt

where

  Prod = k [u_1]

              Ra
  Conv = ------------ ( Nu_conv - 1 )
         16 Re^3 Pr^2

         1
  Diss = -- [|grad u|^2]
         Re
