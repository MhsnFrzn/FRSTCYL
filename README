This directory contains a f77 code that simulates a fluid flow between
two no-slip/slip walls (z-direction), which is periodic in the x and y
directions.  It can also evolve a temperature field with mixed BC, ie
 
 ttab tt + ttbb @tt/@z = ttgb
 ttat tt + ttbt @tt/@z = ttgt

The code uses libraries ESSL/SCSL/FFTW3, and select between the at 
compilation time using C pre-processing. See Makefile for details.

Further information is in the following files:

README_eqns: the equations solved for velocity, temperature,
             smoke and particles

README_gbal: equations for global balances of fluid quantities

README_time: definitions of the timers

rplus is added
