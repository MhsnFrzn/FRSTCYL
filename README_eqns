We solve the following set of equations

**************************************

Fluid velocity:

  div u = 0

  Du                 Ra               1
  -- = -grad p + ---------- tt ez +  --- lap u 
  Dt             16 Re^2 Pr           Re

with

  u = 0 at z = -1 and z = 1,

where the mean value of grad p is some constant k:

  k = 1 for standard channel flow
  k = 0 for standard thermal convection.

u   = fluid velocity
p   = fluid pressure
tt  = fluid temperature (see below)

Re  = Reynolds number based on wall friction
Pr  = Prandtl number (= nu/kappa)
Ra  = Rayleigh number (normalized to standard thermal
      convection usage:  e.g., Ra_crit = 1707.762)
R   = rho_p/rho - 1
Tmax= scale for void fraction
w_s = settling velocity

ez = (0,0,1)

**************************************

Fluid temperature:

  Dtt     1          
  --- = ----- lap tt 
  Dt    Re Pr           

where tt is advected with the particles velocity.

The BC are:

 ttab tt + ttbb @tt/@z = ttgb
 ttat tt + ttbt @tt/@z = ttgt
